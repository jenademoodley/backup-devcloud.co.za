In order to improve performance of your application, you need to understand the nature of your application, i.e. is your application performing mainly read or write operations. There are a few ways to determine this, which is discussed in the NFS troubleshooting blog post, however an easy way to determine the activity of your EFS on your EC2 instance is to use the <code>mountstats</code> command.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ mountstats /mnt/efs

</code></pre><p>As you can see, my EFS is performing write heavy operations, and you can even see the RPC calls made most often to the EFS, the majority of which is <code>GETATTR</code> and <code>SETATTR</code>. These are for setting metadata attributes, indicating that my workload is also metadata based.</p><p>Depending on the type or workload you have, i.e. read intensive or write intensive workloads, there are different options you can configure in order to enhance the performance of your application using EFS.</p><h2 id="improving-read-operation-performance">Improving read operation performance</h2><p>As we discussed, latency experienced on EFS is due to metadata access sequence of the NFS protocol. We cannot change how files are accessed from the EFS, however, we know that the local disk used is faster than EFS. Therefore, if we want to improve access time for files, we can cache the files on the local disk, effectively reducing latency by taking the NFS protocol out of the equation. This can be done using a file system cache (or fs-cache), which was created for this very purpose. A popular file system cache we can use is <code>cachefilesd</code>. To show the effects of using a cache, we can perform a test in which we access a file before and after using the cache to observe the performance improvements.</p><h4 id="setting-up-cachefilesd">Setting up cachefilesd</h4><p>We first need to install <code>cachefilesd</code> using the standard package manager of your distribution.</p><h6 id="amazon-linux-centos-rhel">Amazon Linux, CentOS, RHEL</h6><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ sudo yum install cachefilesd -y</code></pre><h6 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h6><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ sudo apt-get update

While the access time may seem small, as the latency occurs per-file operation, this time will drastically increase for larger number of files in deeper directories.</p><h4 id="limitations-and-caveats">Limitations and Caveats</h4><p>By definition, the operating system will check the cache first before accessing the EFS. This means that, should a file not exist, the entire cache will be checked before accessing the EFS. This can induce performance issues if the cache is very large and new files are being accessed more frequently than older files. This can be mitigated by configuring more options on cachefilesd such as cache culling, which&nbsp;involves discarding objects from the cache that have been used less recently than other objects. This is explained further in the <code>cachefilesd</code> <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/cachefilesd.conf" target="_blank">man pages</a>.</p><h2 id="improving-write-operation-performance">Improving write operation performance</h2><p>While using <code>cachefilesd</code> can speed up access to an existing file, it does not help much for write operations as the file may not yet exist (in the case of new files), and the NFS protocol would still need to access the metadata in order to perform updates such as updating the last modified time, and update the block size. In order to get around this limitation, we can take advantage of the resilient nature of EFS.&nbsp;</p><p>EFS is designed to be accessed by thousands of clients simultaneously, and emphasis is placed on throughput of data written to the file system from all clients. This means that EFS is more situated for parallel workloads, or rather it is with parallel workloads that EFS really shines. As such, we can improve write performance by performing our commands in parallel. This can be done using two methods:</p><ol><li>Use multiple clients (i.e. use multiple EC2 instances).&nbsp;</li><li>Use a tool such as GNU parallel or <code>fpsync</code> to run the commands in parallel.</li></ol><p>The first option is the more recommended option as it may be difficult to rebuild your application to execute operations in parallel. However, for regular commands run on multiple files such as <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, or <code>rsync</code> would benefit greatly if configured to operate on files in parallel. By default, these commands perform serial operations, i.e. it would perform the action on one file at a time. Performing the operations on multiple files simultaneously with a single command would greatly improve the performance. To demonstrate the results, as well as the ease of using a parallel utility, we can perform the below test using GNU parallel.&nbsp;<br></p><h4 id="installing-gnu-parallel">Installing GNU Parallel</h4><p>The commands to install GNU parallel would differ per distribution. For RPM-based distributions (RedHat, CentOS, Amazon Linux), it is available in the <code>epel</code> repository. For Ubuntu, it is available in the default repository. The commands to install GNU parallel would be as below:</p><h6 id="rhel-7">RHEL 7</h6><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

$ sudo apt-get install parallel</code></pre><h4 id="running-commands-in-parallel">Running commands in parallel</h4><p>We first need to create a large number of small files on our local disk. In my test, I have created 10000 files. For reference, I am using a standard <code>t2.large</code>&nbsp;EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2, with a general purpose (gp2) volume of 8 GB in size.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ mkdir /tmp/efs; for each in $(seq 1 10000); do SUFFIX=$(mktemp -u _XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX); sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/efs/${SUFFIX} bs=64k count=1; done</code></pre><p>We can then copy these files to the EFS with <code>rsync</code> using the standard serial method, and measure the time it takes to copy the files.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ cd /tmp/efs; time sudo find -L . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec rsync -avR '{}' /mnt/efs/ \;
...
real    9m11.494s
user    0m34.186s
sys     0m10.303s</code></pre><p>The results show that it took longer than 9 minutes to copy 10000 files to the EFS using <code>rsync</code>. If we purge the directory, and use <code>rsync</code> in parallel:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ cd /tmp/efs; time find -L . -maxdepth 1 -type f | sudo parallel rsync -avR {} /mnt/efs/
...
real    5m41.274s
user    1m1.279s
sys     0m37.556s
</code></pre><p>The files took longer than 5 minutes, effectively reducing the copy time by almost half. Furthermore, GNU parallel runs as many parallel jobs as there are CPU cores. As the <code>t2.large</code> instance contains 2 cores, this explains why the time was almost halved. However, GNU parallel allows you to specify the number of jobs by using the<code>--jobs</code> flag. If we set the <code>--jobs</code> flag to 0, it would try to run as many jobs as possible with the amount of CPU available.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>$ cd /tmp/efs; time find -L . -maxdepth 1 -type f | sudo parallel --jobs 0 rsync -avR {} /mnt/efs/
...
real    3m25.578s
user    1m2.320s
sys     0m45.163s
</code></pre><p>Using as many jobs as possible, we reduced the time taken to about a third of the time it would have taken when using the serial copy method. You can also edit and configure GNU parallel commands as your needs. You can find a more detailed tutorial of GNU parallel <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/parallel_tutorial.html#GNU-Parallel-Tutorial">here</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Knowing your application's usage patterns can greatly assist you with configuring your EFS. Using the above suggestions correctly can help you to use the EFS to it's full potential, however incorrect use of these suggestions, such as implementing <code>cachefilesd</code> for an application which only accesses recent data on the EFS, can cause further performance degradation. There are additional caching options you can look at such as <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php" target="_blank">PHP-opcache</a> for PHP-based websites, and incorporating a CDN such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank">CloudFront</a>, however these are website specific caching mechanisms. You need to identify a good mix of services and caching mechanisms in order to improve your application performance on EFS, and I hope this blog post gives you a good starting point on improving your experience with EFS.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 23, 2020</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevcloud.co.za%2Fimproving-efs-performance-part-2%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://devcloud.co.za/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevcloud.co.za%2Fimproving-efs-performance-part-2%2F&amp;via=DevCloud&amp;text=Improving%20EFS%20Performance%20(Part%202)" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://devcloud.co.za/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevcloud.co.za%2Fimproving-efs-performance-part-2%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fdevcloud.co.za%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F7%2FAWS_EFS-system_DIMq8h4.jpg&amp;description=Improving%20EFS%20Performance%20(Part%202)" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://devcloud.co.za/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevcloud.co.za%2Fimproving-efs-performance-part-2%2F&amp;title=Improving%20EFS%20Performance%20(Part%202)" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://devcloud.co.za/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Improving%20EFS%20Performance%20(Part%202) https%3A%2F%2Fdevcloud.co.za%2Fimproving-efs-performance-part-2%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://devcloud.co.za/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://devcloud.co.za/media/website/39186496_1809180909164306_8750795900512632832_o.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Jenade Moodley"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://devcloud.co.za/authors/jenade-moodley/" class="invert" rel="author">Jenade Moodley</a></h3><p>Hi there.
