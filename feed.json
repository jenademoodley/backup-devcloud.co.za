Often times these tasks are part of an ECS service and so they will be restarted, but if your architect is not stateless and those stopped task caused errors, then the task stopping can cause an issue with your application. An example of this would be a container which uses socket connections such as Redis.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In such cases, knowing the cause of the task stopping would be of utmost importance as you would need to prevent the task from stopping again. This fact reigns true even more so in production environments, where you also need to report on why any failures occurred in the environment. On ECS, when a task is stopped, you would be able to view the stopped task in your ECS console. When you select your cluster, you can select the Tasks tab which contains a list of stopped tasks.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--center\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"1\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://devcloud.co.za/media/posts/14/gallery/Screenshot-8.png\" data-size=\"1444x307\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://devcloud.co.za/media/posts/14/gallery/Screenshot-8-thumbnail.png\" height=\"153\" width=\"720\" alt=\"Stopped Task\" />\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Stopped Task</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <p>\n    You can also select the task to view even more task details, as well as the container details (including the exit code) from each container. The container code is extremely useful if the task was stopped due to a container level issue, such as out of memory errors.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--center\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"3\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://devcloud.co.za/media/posts/14/gallery/Screenshot-9.png\" data-size=\"1463x755\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://devcloud.co.za/media/posts/14/gallery/Screenshot-9-thumbnail.png\" height=\"372\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" />\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Additional Task Details</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://devcloud.co.za/media/posts/14/gallery/Screenshot-10.png\" data-size=\"1427x789\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://devcloud.co.za/media/posts/14/gallery/Screenshot-10-thumbnail.png\" height=\"398\" width=\"720\" alt=\"\" />\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Container Details</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n    <h3 id=\"why-do-we-need-to-store-ecs-stopped-tasks\">\n      Why do we Need to Store ECS Stopped Tasks?\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The above information is certainly useful. Unfortunately, stopped ECS task details only remain in the console for at least an hour, after which it is removed. If you notice that the task was stopped after an hour, chances are that you will not be able to view the reason why the task was stopped. This is mentioned in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListTasks.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" data-link-popup-id=\"1602168481251\">AWS documentation</a>:<line-separator></line-separator>\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      Recently stopped tasks might appear in the returned results.

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    When using ECS, you run containers in the form of an ECS task, where each task can contain one or more container definitions, up to a maximum of 10. If you want to monitor the performance of your tasks, you can monitor the containers at the task level. This does offer good insight into the working of your task, but it doesn't allow you to view the performance of each container. In a delicate environment where you need to monitor each and every aspect of the system, monitoring each container would be extremely beneficial. There is no CloudWatch metric which monitors container-level resource usage, but it is possible to build our own CloudWatch metric using the container-level resource usage statistics provided by the Docker daemon on the EC2 host. These statistics are obtained by the more widely known <code>docker stats</code> command.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The <code>docker stats</code> command returns a live data stream for running containers. With this command, you would be able to obtain the CPU, memory, network I/O, as well as disk I/O usage of each container. For this post, I will only be covering CPU and memory usage. You can take a more detailed look at <code>docker stats</code> from <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker's documentation</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To provide a short overview of the steps we will be deploying, we will first create a script which obtains the resource usage statistics using <code>docker stats</code>, and upload these values to CloudWatch metrics. The statistics obtained will need to be easily obtained and parsed, hence the statistics will be obtained as a <code>JSON</code>, and be parsed using <code>jq</code> (more on this below). This script needs to be run at set intervals in order to gain a good understanding of the container resource usage patterns. To do this, we will create a cron job which will run this script at a set frequency.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"installing-the-dependencies\">\n      Installing the dependencies\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    As we will be sending the metrics to CloudWatch, and parsing through the <code>JSON</code> statistics using <code>jq</code>, we need to install the AWS CLI, as well as the <code>jq</code> binary. As you are using ECS, you would most likely be using the ECS-optimized AMI, which is based on Amazon Linux, or Amazon Linux 2. As such, the commands you would use to install these dependencies would be as below:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>sudo yum install python3 python3-pip jq -y\nsudo pip3 install -U awscli</code></pre>\n\n    <h2 id=\"creating-the-script\">\n      Creating the script\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Let's first look at the commands which will be included in the script.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    We first need to obtain the resource usage statistics using <code>docker stats</code>. By default,<code> docker stats</code> is presented as text, which is not very easy to handle when trying to filter for specific values. As such, we can format the statistics into a <code>JSON</code> using the <code>--format</code> parameter. This will be based on a publicly available example <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/KyleBanks/8befbf0ae0d0535fa27d33cb67b40bd1\" target=\"_blank\">docker-stats-json</a>. The statistics will then be formed into a valid <code>JSON</code> object using <code>jq</code>.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>STATS=$(docker stats --no-stream --format \"{\\\"container\\\": \\\"{{ .Container }}\\\",\\\"name\\\": \\\"{{ .Name }}\\\", \\\"memory\\\": { \\\"raw\\\": \\\"{{ .MemUsage }}\\\", \\\"percent\\\": \\\"{{ .MemPerc }}\\\"}, \\\"cpu\\\": \\\"{{ .CPUPerc }}\\\"}\" | jq '.' -s -c )</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    As we will be uploading the data to CloudWatch metrics, CloudWatch is region-specific. As such we also need to include the region in our script. We can obtain the region programmatically from the metadata service.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>REGION=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/region 2&gt; /dev/null)</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    We also need a way to identify and structure our metrics in CloudWatch. One good way to manage this is to use the EC2 instance ID as a dimension for the metric, as well as the Container Name, and Container ID.

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    If you are using an NFS compatible Distributed File System (such as a Samba server or EFS), you may notice a slight delay when writing files to the file system, more specifically, when you create a new file from one of the NFS clients, it may take a couple of seconds longer to appear on another client, even though it is already available on the original client.\n<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This behaviour can be explained by the NFS buffer cache. By default, when you are writing data to a file in Linux, it is first written in memory. This is appropriately called a buffer, i.e. it can be described as a smaller and faster storage area, which sits in front of the actual storage device. This is to improve performance as memory is much faster than a hard disk or solid state drive. The same is true for NFS, where writes are first written to the NFS buffer, before being flushed (or synced) to the NFS storage. This improves performance on the client performing the writes as the clients do not have to wait for the data to be synced to the NFS disk on every write, allowing more writes to be processed.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    However, if your application is heavily dependent on consistency, i.e. it needs to be available on another client as soon as the write is made, this buffer will not be ideal for you. Instead, you can then opt-in to allow writes to be written directly to the server, bypassing the cache. This can be controlled by the <code>sync</code> NFS mount option. By default, the NFS client will use the <code>async</code> mount option unless specified otherwise. <code>async</code> refers to asynchronous, where data is flushed asynchronously to the main server. If you switch to using the <code>sync</code> mount option, data will be flushed to the server immediately, which allows for greater consistency but at a great performance cost. Referring to the <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/5/nfs\" target=\"_blank\">NFS man pages</a>:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>The sync mount option\n    The NFS client treats the sync mount option differently than some other file systems (refer to mount(8) for a description of the generic sync and async mount options). If neither sync nor async is specified (or if the async option is specified), the NFS client delays sending application writes to the server until any of these events occur:\n\n       Memory pressure forces reclamation of system memory resources.\n\n       An application flushes file data explicitly with sync(2), msync(2), or fsync(3).\n\n       An application closes a file with close(2).\n\n       The file is locked/unlocked via fcntl(2).\n\n    In other words, under normal circumstances, data written by an application may not immediately appear on the server that hosts the file.\n\n    If the sync option is specified on a mount point, any system call that writes data to files on that mount point causes that data to be flushed to the server before the system call returns control to user space. This provides greater data cache coherence among clients, but at a significant performance cost.\n\n    Applications can use the O_SYNC open flag to force application writes to individual files to go to the server immediately without the use of the sync mount option.</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Like all NFS mount options, the <code>sync</code> mount option is specified when mounting the file system. As previously mentioned, it should be used with caution as it can cause significant performance impact for write operations.\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    If you are using an Application Load Balancer, you may have come across the \"Least Outstanding Requests\" (or LOR) load balancing algorithm. A load balancing algorithm dictates how requests are sent to targets. With the default round robin configuration, all requests will be split among the targets equally, regardless of the state of the target. This can cause issues if the requests are not equal (i.e. spiky workloads) as this may result in overloading of requests to one of the targets, and under-utilization of other targets. However, the least outstanding requests algorithm aims to solve this by sending requests to targets with the lowest number of outstanding (or existing) connections. Straight from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/application-load-balancer-now-supports-least-outstanding-requests-algorithm-for-load-balancing-requests/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS' blog post</a>:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      With this algorithm, as the new request comes in, the load balancer will send it to the target with least number of outstanding requests. Targets processing long-standing requests or having lower processing capabilities are not burdened with more requests and the load is evenly spread across targets. This also helps the new targets to effectively take load off of overloaded targets.\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <h2 id=\"what-is-a-least-outstanding-request\">\n      What is a \"Least Outstanding Request\"\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Simply put, outstanding requests refers to the number of requests that each target is currently processing. In order for this algorithm to work effectively, the ALB needs to keep track of the number of existing requests per target, and update this list whenever a request is completed, or a new request is made. The ALB will route an incoming request to the target with the lowest number of these requests. This also means that a target could be at the bottom of this list for one request, and at the top of the list for the next request, hence the process has a very fluid state.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"some-of-my-targets-receive-more-requests-than-others\">\n      Some of my targets receive more requests than others\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Based on the nature of this algorithm, this can be expected. The ALB will route requests to targets with the least number of outstanding requests at that point in time. It will not consider how many requests have already been sent to that target as these requests would have already been fulfilled.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Consider a scenario in which there are no requests served to any of your targets, or if there is an equal number of long lasting connections on all targets. If a new request comes in, that request can be served by any of the targets, and an arbitrary target (let's call this target A) is chosen. If the request is completed, and a new request comes in, the scenario is exactly the same, hence target A can be chosen again. It is not uncommon for there to be an imbalance of requests in such scenarios. This should also not cause any issues with resource utilization as each target would handle it's fair share of requests at any given time.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    From an analysis view point, we tend to look at the number of requests processed by each target over the course of a period of time (such as over an hour, day, week, month, etc), which often causes confusion. When dealing with the least outstanding requests algorithm, we need to take into account that it does not consider the number of requests over a period of time, but the number of requests that each target is processing at that exact moment in time when the request is received.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"when-should-i-use-the-least-outstanding-requests-algorithm\">\n      When should I use the least outstanding requests algorithm\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The least outstanding requests algorithm should be used in either or both of the below scenarios:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Not all of the requests are equal (i.e. requests vary in complexity).</li><li>Each of the targets very in processing capability (for example, each EC2 instance used as a target is a different instance type).</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    If all of your targets are the same, and you expect a similar form and complexity of all requests, you may not see any benefit to using the least outstanding requests algorithm, and you should consider switching back to the round robin load balancing algorithm.&nbsp;\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n    <h2 id=\"the-port-mapping-problem\">\n      The Port Mapping Problem\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    A popular function of containers is to run a service such as a web or application server to which clients connect to using HTTP, TCP or socket connections. By default, Docker will allocate a port from the host to the container from the ephemeral port range, but you can manually map or expose a specific host port, such as mapping port 80 on the host to port 8080 on the container. This works fine for individual containers and tasks, but if you need to run another container of the same type, you would then need another host as you cannot bind more than one container to a specific host port (i.e. if there is a container or service listening on a specific port such as port 80, no other service or container can use or bind that specific port.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Additionally, if your container is lightweight and uses minimal CPU and memory resources, this results in resource wastage as you would need to launch an entirely new instance simply to cater for this port conflict. If you wish to configure reactive scaling (i.e. scale the number of containers due to demand), this is also a blocking factor as this means that you either need additional EC2 instances on standby (increased cost), or spin up a new instance in accordance to demand (slower scale time). You would have to accurately map and plan your port usage on your EC2 hosts such that you can launch your containers without port conflicts, which increases management overhead.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"enter-dynamic-port-mapping\">\n      Enter Dynamic Port Mapping\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    If you are going to be using multiple containers to host a service, you would also need to configure a suitable and robust solution in order to access each of these containers. When considering HTTP requests, a popular choice in AWS is to use the Application Load Balancer (ALB), often called a Layer 7 load balancer (referring to layer 7 Application layer in the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/\" target=\"_blank\">OSI model</a>, hence the name). An ALB will allow you to effectively distribute (or balance) requests to multiple targets to which it is connected to. While the port on the ALB to which you will issue requests to will always remain the same (port 80 for HTTP requests, and port 443 for HTTPS requests), the back end targets can each be listening on a different port, for example one target can be listening on port 8080, another can be listening on port 8000, etc. Multiple targets can even belong on the same EC2 instance, provided that the ports are different.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Using this functionality, we can apply this behaviour to containers. We can run the containers without specifying the port mapping (i.e. allow Docker to map the container port to an ephemeral port on the host), and then configure these containers to be targets for the ALB. This would allow you to run multiple containers of the same type, on the same EC2 instance, effectively reducing cost and management overhead. The ECS service is also capable of determining which host port your container has been bound to, and can configure the target registration for that specific port and container on the ALB, which allows for a seamless configuration.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"setting-up-dynamic-port-mapping\">\n      Setting up Dynamic Port Mapping\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Dynamic Port Mapping is relatively easy to configure. From the ECS service side, all you need to do is set the \"Host\" port in the container mapping to \"0\". A JSON snippet of the task definition would therefore look like this:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-json\"><code>\"portMappings\": [\n        {\n          \"hostPort\": 0,\n          \"protocol\": \"tcp\",\n          \"containerPort\": 80\n        }\n      ]</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    However, additional configurations may need to be done on your VPC and container instances in order to allow the connections to successfully reach the container. As the containers will be mapped to the ephemeral ports of the host, you would need to ensure the following criteria is met:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>The security groups attached to your container instances or tasks allow for incoming connections on the ephemeral port range from the ALB nodes.</li><li>The NACLs used by the subnet in which your tasks or container instances are located must allow inbound and outbound connections on the ephemeral port range.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>\n    The ephemeral port range used by Docker versions 1.6.0 and later will refer to the&nbsp;<code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</code> kernel parameter on the host. If this kernel parameter is not available, or if you are using an earlier version of Docker, the default ephemeral port range is used, which ranges from ports&nbsp;49153 through 65535. In general,&nbsp;ports below 32768 fall outside of the ephemeral port range. As a general rule of thumb, you can allow incoming connections from ports 32768 through 65535 in order to account for both scenarios and avoid any issues.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"considerations\">\n      Considerations\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    As you can now have multiple containers running on a single host to which you can connect to using your ALB, a logical consideration is having too many containers on the same host. This can cause resource contention, and can cause containers to be stopped if the configurations are too restrictive. You should actively configure task and container memory and CPU limits so that each container will be given ample resources on the host in order to function effectively.\n  </p>",

We cannot change how files are accessed from the EFS, however, we know that the local disk used is faster than EFS. Therefore, if we want to improve access time for files, we can cache the files on the local disk, effectively reducing latency by taking the NFS protocol out of the equation. This can be done using a file system cache (or fs-cache), which was created for this very purpose. A popular file system cache we can use is <code>cachefilesd</code>.

This is 3 times faster than the initial access time. While the access time may seem small, as the latency occurs per-file operation, this time will drastically increase for larger number of files in deeper directories.\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"limitations-and-caveats\">\n      Limitations and Caveats\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    By definition, the operating system will check the cache first before accessing the EFS. This means that, should a file not exist, the entire cache will be checked before accessing the EFS. This can induce performance issues if the cache is very large and new files are being accessed more frequently than older files. This can be mitigated by configuring more options on cachefilesd such as cache culling, which&nbsp;involves discarding objects from the cache that have been used less recently than other objects. This is explained further in the <code>cachefilesd</code> <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/5/cachefilesd.conf\" target=\"_blank\">man pages</a>.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"improving-write-operation-performance\">\n      Improving write operation performance\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    While using <code>cachefilesd</code> can speed up access to an existing file, it does not help much for write operations as the file may not yet exist (in the case of new files), and the NFS protocol would still need to access the metadata in order to perform updates such as updating the last modified time, and update the block size. In order to get around this limitation, we can take advantage of the resilient nature of EFS.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    EFS is designed to be accessed by thousands of clients simultaneously, and emphasis is placed on throughput of data written to the file system from all clients. This means that EFS is more situated for parallel workloads, or rather it is with parallel workloads that EFS really shines. As such, we can improve write performance by performing our commands in parallel. This can be done using two methods:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Use multiple clients (i.e. use multiple EC2 instances).&nbsp;</li><li>Use a tool such as GNU parallel or <code>fpsync</code> to run the commands in parallel.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>\n    The first option is the more recommended option as it may be difficult to rebuild your application to execute operations in parallel. However, for regular commands run on multiple files such as <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, or <code>rsync</code> would benefit greatly if configured to operate on files in parallel. By default, these commands perform serial operations, i.e. it would perform the action on one file at a time. Performing the operations on multiple files simultaneously with a single command would greatly improve the performance. To demonstrate the results, as well as the ease of using a parallel utility, we can perform the below test using GNU parallel.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"installing-gnu-parallel\">\n      Installing GNU Parallel\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    The commands to install GNU parallel would differ per distribution. For RPM-based distributions (RedHat, CentOS, Amazon Linux), it is available in the <code>epel</code> repository. For Ubuntu, it is available in the default repository. The commands to install GNU parallel would be as below:\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"rhel-7\">\n      RHEL 7\n    </h6>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm\n$ sudo yum install parallel -y</code></pre>\n\n    <h6 id=\"amazon-linux-rhel-6\">\n      Amazon Linux, RHEL 6\n    </h6>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm\n$ sudo yum install parallel -y</code></pre>\n\n    <h6 id=\"amazon-linux-2\">\n      Amazon Linux 2\n    </h6>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel\n$ sudo yum install parallel -y\n</code></pre>\n\n    <h6 id=\"centos-6-centos-7\">\n      CentOS 6, CentOS 7\n    </h6>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ sudo yum install epel-release\n$ sudo yum install parallel -y\n</code></pre>\n\n    <h6 id=\"ubuntu\">\n      Ubuntu\n    </h6>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install parallel</code></pre>\n\n    <h4 id=\"running-commands-in-parallel\">\n      Running commands in parallel\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    We first need to create a large number of small files on our local disk. In my test, I have created 10000 files. For reference, I am using a standard <code>t2.large</code>&nbsp;EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2, with a general purpose (gp2) volume of 8 GB in size.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ mkdir /tmp/efs; for each in $(seq 1 10000); do SUFFIX=$(mktemp -u _XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX); sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/efs/${SUFFIX} bs=64k count=1; done</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    We can then copy these files to the EFS with <code>rsync</code> using the standard serial method, and measure the time it takes to copy the files.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ cd /tmp/efs; time sudo find -L . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec rsync -avR '{}' /mnt/efs/ \\;\n...\nreal    9m11.494s\nuser    0m34.186s\nsys     0m10.303s</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    The results show that it took longer than 9 minutes to copy 10000 files to the EFS using <code>rsync</code>. If we purge the directory, and use <code>rsync</code> in parallel:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ cd /tmp/efs; time find -L . -maxdepth 1 -type f | sudo parallel rsync -avR {} /mnt/efs/\n...\nreal    5m41.274s\nuser    1m1.279s\nsys     0m37.556s\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    The files took longer than 5 minutes, effectively reducing the copy time by almost half. Furthermore, GNU parallel runs as many parallel jobs as there are CPU cores. As the <code>t2.large</code> instance contains 2 cores, this explains why the time was almost halved. However, GNU parallel allows you to specify the number of jobs by using the<code> --jobs</code> flag. If we set the <code>--jobs</code> flag to 0, it would try to run as many jobs as possible with the amount of CPU available.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>$ cd /tmp/efs; time find -L . -maxdepth 1 -type f | sudo parallel --jobs 0 rsync -avR {} /mnt/efs/\n...\nreal    3m25.578s\nuser    1m2.320s\nsys     0m45.163s\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Using as many jobs as possible, we reduced the time taken to about a third of the time it would have taken when using the serial copy method. You can also edit and configure GNU parallel commands as your needs. You can find a more detailed tutorial of GNU parallel <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/parallel_tutorial.html#GNU-Parallel-Tutorial\">here</a>.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"conclusion\">\n      Conclusion\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Knowing your application's usage patterns can greatly assist you with configuring your EFS. Using the above suggestions correctly can help you to use the EFS to it's full potential, however incorrect use of these suggestions, such as implementing <code>cachefilesd</code> for an application which only accesses recent data on the EFS, can cause further performance degradation. There are additional caching options you can look at such as <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php\" target=\"_blank\">PHP-opcache</a> for PHP-based websites, and incorporating a CDN such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\" target=\"_blank\">CloudFront</a>, however these are website specific caching mechanisms. You need to identify a good mix of services and caching mechanisms in order to improve your application performance on EFS, and I hope this blog post gives you a good starting point on improving your experience with EFS.\n  </p>",

EFS, at present, can only be accessed by Linux-based clients, and every single component of Linux, be it an application or configuration, consists of files. In short, every action on your Linux operating system requires accessing a file.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Unpacking that analogy, there are only two options which are applicable to the use of files; reading, and writing to a file. From the operating system's point of view, either of these actions is interpreted as an \"operation\", and there are appropriate read and write operations available as the operating system would need to perform different actions for these operations. This is unpacked further here (coming soon).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    When reading or writing to a file, the operating system needs to first obtain the metadata for the file, which contains various information about the file including the inode of the file, the permissions to determine if the file is accessible by the user or application performing the operation, as well as the block size and IO block (location on the disk) for the actual data on the file. If the user or application has sufficient permissions to access the file, the operating system would then access the contents of the file from the disk.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Coming back to EFS, we know that EFS uses the NFS protocol to run file operations. What you may not know, is that NFS is not too efficient with handling metadata, which is necessary for all file operations. To briefly explain, your file would be located within a directory, such as the root EFS directory or several directories within the EFS. When trying to access a file, the NFS protocol will recursively check each directory to determine if the user has sufficient permissions to access each directory, before finally arriving at the specified file. As you are connecting to the EFS over a network, each of these checks is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC). As these checks occur over a network, while these checks occur very fast, they are much slower when compared to directly attached storage options. A deeper overview of the NFS protocol sequence is explained <a href=\"http://www.eventhelix.com/realtimemantra/networking/NFS_Protocol_Sequence_Diagram.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"whats-next\">\n      What's next?\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Now that we understand what causes latency with the EFS, we can go ahead and start looking methods for improving the performance of the applications which use the EFS. This is discussed in the <a href=\"https://devcloud.co.za/improving-efs-performance-part-2/\">second part of this blog post</a>.\n  </p>",
